### Greetings ðŸ‘‹


My name is Jacob.

I'm a data scientist, an artist, a writer, musician, polymath, and can often be found new experimenting in new fields/mediums.

For the last year, the lion's share of my attention has gone into learning Data Science techniques and principles at Lambda School. Through their course and my own tenacity I have learned how to use python and various libraries associated with the language (geopandas, matplotlib, pandas, plotly, scikit-learn, seaborn). The course included coverage of SQL; it should be noted that among my priorities post-Lambda are to deepend my knowledge of this language.

I am passionate about the social policy, the public sector, and anywhere that the sciences are being applied toward the ever-growing challenge of climate challenge. It is my goal for future work as a prospective employee or contract data engineer/consultant to work with companies and on projects that use data ethically, to improve lives. It is a part of my purpose to use my skills to improve the systems, the execution, and the thought around the future my generation will see and those this generation will not. Aligned with these goals I would like to start working on data-driven journalism with the goal of creating think tanks and communities that produce impactful thought and policies that will bring a brighter, more fair future operating in social and planetary symbiosis.

My other career is in the arts. I am a sculptor and performance artist with a BFA in sculpture. I am interested in creatiing community wide, inclusive education workshops and centers. It is my goal to exhibit and curate art across the social spectrum, to make safe spaces to learn and to perform or create, to express. My personal work is often immersive, explores identity, consciousness, AI, and abdsurdism. I look forward to seeing how my new role as a data scientist is going to impact my art and my ability to produce and create spaces for others to show and make art.

I am an open book. It would be fantastic to hear from you, whether for professinoal concerns or artistic.
